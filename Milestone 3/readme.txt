made readme bc i dont want my commit text to be long 

PathNavHardwareV1 is untouched from Sundays work.
PathNavV1 is the sim file, has been updated to more reliably solve the maze. might not work all the time but its decent.
This file does not incl any of your algorithm stuff, so youll have to copy paste into here if you testing.


update 20 Oct 22:11
pushed 4 files, PathNavV3, PathNavShortestRoute, robotParameters and createShortPath
Run robotParameters
Run PathNavV3 sim to "explore" maze using LSRB
Run createShortPath, creates shortest path directions
Run PathNavShortestRoute, which uses the directions mentioned above

****NB****
if changing robot start pos, edit the x and y variables in robotParameters to ensure a consistent start point across sims.
